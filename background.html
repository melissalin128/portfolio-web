        <h2 class="title-box">My Story to Data Science</h2>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;My journey to data science was not a straight path. In high school, I was drawn to international relations because I loved public speaking and the analytical thinking I developed through debate. In college, I spent my first 3 semesters <span style="color:#59a9ff;">exploring different subjects</span>. I challenged myself to take at least one class each semester unrelated to my major, hoping it would spark a new interest or reveal a passion. At the same time, I applied to every internship I could. My goal was simple: either eliminate a path that was not right for me or discover a new opportunity.</p>
    
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;After freshman year, I landed a sales internship and quickly realized I was more interested in the analysis and management side of the team than in sales itself. With the support of my manager, I transitioned to corporate operations, <span style="color:#59a9ff;">tracking team progress and helping optimize performance</span>. That experience taught me the value of <span style="color:#59a9ff;">stepping outside my comfort zone</span>, taking initiative, and embracing new challenges.</p>
    
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;Through these experiences, I discovered that I loved <span style="color:#59a9ff;">math when it was applied to real-world problems</span> and that coding could be a tool to bring insights to life. A friend introduced me to data science, and it immediately felt like the <span style="color:#59a9ff;">perfect balance of math, coding, and storytelling</span>. Since then, I have been passionate about <span style="color:#59a9ff;">transforming data into insights</span> that inform decisions and create meaningful impact. Each step along the way, from taking classes outside my comfort zone to pursuing diverse internships, prepared me to approach problems with <span style="color:#59a9ff;">curiosity, creativity, and persistence</span>.</p>
